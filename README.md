# Cool Auto Animals

Goal is to create a Super Auto Pets copy in order to become familiar with Unity and C#, and learn game development and coding principles.

## Getting Started

1. Make a Unity account.
2. Install and run Unity Hub: https://unity.com/download
4. Make a GitHub account.
5. Install and run GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

### Setting up GitHub Desktop

Watch [this video][1] by Brackeys for help.

1. Log in to GitHub, fill in name and email (use the same email as GitHub).
2. Clone this repo `https://github.com/winstonco/cool-auto-animals.git` in whatever folder you want the Unity project to be located. A new repo folder named `cool-auto-animals` will be created. I recommend creating a new "Projects" or "Unity Projects" folder, or something similar, and cloning in that.

### Setting up Unity

1. Activate a free personal license or a Unity Student license.
2. Install Unity editor `2020.3.30f1`.
3. Click `Open`, `Add project from disk`, and choose the **project** folder *inside* the **repo** folder. If it has the `.git` folder, and `.gitignore` and `README.md` files around it, that's the correct one.

If you get this error, you chose wrong.

```
Project failed to open
This project is not valid
```
